Write a C program to accept details of 'n' employee (eno, ename, salary) and display the details of employee having highest salary. Use array of structure.


#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
struct Employee 
{
int eno;
char ename[50];
float salary;
};
int main()
{
int n;
printf("Enter the number of employees: ");
scanf("%d", &n);
struct Employee employees[n];

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
{
printf("Enter details of employee %d:\n", i+1);
printf("Employee number: ");
scanf("%d", &employees[i].eno);
printf("Name: ");
scanf(" %[^\n]", employees[i].ename);
printf("Salary: ");
scanf("%f", &employees[i].salary);
}

struct Employee highest_salary_employee = employees[0];
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
if (employees[i].salary > highest_salary_employee.salary) {
highest_salary_employee = employees[i];
}
}

printf("\nDetails of employee with highest salary:\n");
printf("Employee number: %d\n", highest_salary_employee.eno);
printf("Name: %s\n", highest_salary_employee.ename);
printf("Salary: %f\n", highest_salary_employee.salary);
return 0;
}
