Write C program to accept batting information of cricket team using structure. It contains player name and runs scored by player. Calculate total runs scored by cricket team


#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
struct Player 
{
char name[50];
int runs_scored;
};
int main() 
{
struct Player team[MAX_PLAYERS]; 
int num_players, total_runs = 0;
printf("Enter number of players in the team (max %d): ", MAX_PLAYERS);
scanf("%d", &num_players);
for (int i = 0; i < num_players; i++)
{
printf("Enter name of player %d: ", i+1);
scanf(" %[^\n]", team[i].name);
printf("Enter runs scored by player %d: ", i+1);
scanf("%d", &team[i].runs_scored);
total_runs += team[i].runs_scored;
}
printf("\nTotal runs scored by the team: %d\n", total_runs);
return 0;
}
